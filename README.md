# Hello everybody!ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹âœ¨

### My name is Julian Jara and I'm currently studying computer systems engineering at [TecNM Tijuana](https://www.tijuana.tecnm.mx/)ðŸ’»ðŸ‘€. My main areas of interest are pogramming and Mathematics ðŸ“ˆ (there are not really a great deal of emojis about math, huh?ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜¤), so I'm always trying to merge these two together in my projects ðŸ™Œ.
