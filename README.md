# Hello everybody!👋👋✨

My name is Julian Jara and I'm currently studying my sixth computer systems engineering semester at [TecNM Tijuana](https://www.tijuana.tecnm.mx/)💻👀. My main areas of interest are pogramming and Mathematics 📈 (there are not really a lot of emojis about math, huh?😒😤), so I'm always trying to merge these two together in my projects 🙌.

## Some of my projects and experience 🐱‍💻
In the last couple of years I've been mainly working with C#, MATLAB and SQL Server, even though I'm familiar with Python 🐍, C, MySQL, HTML and CSS. The projects I've done are mostly desktop applications for windows, like CRUD systems. Nevertheless, the last two semesters I experimented with computer graphics, numerical methods and simple simulation, I even had the oportunity to participate in a Hackathon! 🎉.

### Side learning
I'm currently enrolled in a web development udemy course . Besides that, I'm taking the wonderful [Giberth Strang's linear algebra classes from MIT OpenCourseWare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK3O402wf1c&list=PL49CF3715CB9EF31D&index=1).
Finally, I would like to pursue machine learning, generative graphics, bot programming and robotics 🤖 in the future.

### Código Hola mundo
```C#
//Hola Mundo, programa escrito en una computadora de Virgina, US de manera remota desde Tijuana, BC México
using System;

namespace holaMundo
{
        public class Program
        {
                static void Main(string[] args)
                {
                        Console.WriteLine("Hola Mundo!!!");
                        Console.ReadKey();
                }
        }

}
```
