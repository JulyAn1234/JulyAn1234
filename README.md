# Hello everybody!👋👋✨

My name is Julian Jara and I'm currently studying my sixth computer systems engineering semester at [TecNM Tijuana](https://www.tijuana.tecnm.mx/)💻👀. My main areas of interest are pogramming and Mathematics 📈 (there are not really a lot of emojis about math, huh?😒😤), so I'm always trying to merge these two together in my projects 🙌. I encourage you to keep reading if you are interested in getting to know me a little bit better.

## Some of my projects and experience 🐱‍💻
In the last couple of years I've been mainly working with C#, MATLAB and SQL Server, even though I'm familiar with Python 🐍, C, MySQL, HTML and CSS. The projects I've done are mostly desktop applications for windows, like CRUD systems. Nevertheless, the last two semesters I experimented with computer graphics, numerical methods and simple simulation, I even had the oportunity to participate in a Hackathon! 🎉.
